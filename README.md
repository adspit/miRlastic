# miRlastic_HNSCC
miRlastic is a tool to systematically screen for putative mi-mRNA interactions using an elastic-net penalized regression model. 
miRNA target predictions serve as an interaction graph to be validated by given transcriptome expression measurements. For each mRNA an elastic-net penalized regression model is calculated. MiRlastic returns the validated mi/mRNA relationships gathered from the regression models.
